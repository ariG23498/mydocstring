example_function(arg1, arg2=1)

This is an example of a docstring that conforms to the Google style guide. 
The indentation uses four spaces (no tabs). Note that each section starts
with a header such as `Arguments` or `Returns` and its contents is indented.

Arguments:
    arg1 (`int`): This description for this argument fits on one line.
    arg2 (`int`, optional): This description is too long to fit on a
        single line. Note that it is continued by being indented. 

Returns:
    `bool` :  Stating the return type here is optional.

    We can continue putting explanations in this section as long as the text
    is indented.

This text is no longer indented and therefore not part of the `Returns`
section.

Raises:
    ValueError: This is exception is raised when arg1 and arg2 are equal.

Examples:

    Code block 1.
    >>> a = 0
    >>> a
    0

    Code block 2.
    >>> b = 1
    >>> b
    1
